# UnforeSpace EOL

UnforeSpace was made by a few developers of the group and used the official unforetold.space URL. 
**UnforeSpace was not, and is not managed internally from UnforeStudios, nor by the owner of UnforeStudios. This was made seperately by our developers.**

The group of developers working on UnforeSpace decided they had enough, and in a response we discontinued the service. 
**All services below are now EOL.**
  - UnforeSpace
  - UnforeTek
  - UnforeEagler
